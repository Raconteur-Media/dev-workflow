# Agile Web Development

> Everyone involved with a project from the top decision-makers to content creators to IT specialists should meet in-person during the early stages of development so that everyone agrees upon the overall goals. Though it may seem tedious at first, having everyone on the same page from the start saves time by reducing the need for constant emails, phone conversations, and meetings throughout the development cycle. Because all members of the team are engaged right away, what once took 4-8 months to finish can now be accomplished in just a few weeks.

> The most important principle of agile web development involves determining the features that are absolutely needed to launch the site, and putting the rest to the side for phase II.

## Agile Development Components
An agile workflow usually consists of multiple components. The following provides a breakdown of the components found in a typical agile web development workflow:

**Product Backlog:**
A spreadsheet, chart or simply a physical wall covered in index cards that lists all of the features to be included in the final product. The product backlog provides a visual representation of the team’s progress.

**Sprint Backlog:**
A list of the tasks to accomplish during a sprint. Before a sprint, the team chooses items from the product backlog and determines the tasks necessary to meet the user needs. Designers and developers independently assign priority and time estimates for each task, and that data is analyzed after each sprint to inform the next sprint. Some teams prefer to use a physical wall or whiteboard to keep track of tasks while others use free online task management tools like Trello.

**Scrum Meetings:**
Short, daily meetings to check in and set the course for the workday.
Scrum Master – The facilitator of scrum meetings tasked with managing communication between team members.

**Shippable Increments:**
Tangible, fully-functioning applications that showcase a feature or the final product. Ideally, each sprint will result in a shippable increment.
A quick tip that’s worth mentioning as you populate your product backlog is to create user personas. User personas are fictional characters that represent the goals, behaviors, and skills of your final product’s potential users. Focusing on personas can help you identify which features you need to include. User personas may be derived from data collected through interviews or focus groups

## Additional Benefits of Agile Web Development

Apart from what was already covered above, there are certain concrete benefits to using agile web development methodologies compared to traditional or other methods. The following section outlines these benefits.

### 1. Faster Feedback

First drafts are never perfect. In fact, sometimes you can follow a client’s specifications to a T, yet the final product looks nothing like what they had in mind. By completing tasks in iterations and having something tangible to share with users after each step, teams can make changes along the way and **avoid a complete overhaul** six months down the line. Having brief, daily scrum meetings gives team members an opportunity to communicate about individual small issues and resolve them before they become big problems for everyone.

### 2. Keeping Up With Change

The old adage “change is the only constant” couldn’t be truer when it comes to web development. Instead of viewing changes as unexpected obstacles to overcome, agile developers embrace change as an inevitable part of the learning process.

### 3. Higher Productivity

Agile processes provide ample opportunities to measure productivity, which helps project managers better estimate workloads.

### 4. Lower Costs

Faster and more efficient development eliminates the need for overtime pay.

### 5. Greater Customer Satisfaction

Since applications go through so many checks before launch, customers are more likely to get a bug-free product that they are happy with.

### 6. Improved Worker Morale

When team members get to see the fruits of their labor in shippable increments, they know they’re progressing in the right direction, which encourages them to keep working toward a goal. Team members are also more likely to feel a sense of shared ownership in the project, which is more motivating than artificial urgency.

### 7. Better Accountability

Iterative methodologies make it easier to track the performance of individual team members, and it gives managers a way to measure the team’s overall commitment level throughout the development process. This information can help them set more realistic goals and give executives accurate timelines.

### 8. No More Detailed Project Plans

Forgoing a project plan isn’t the same as not planning. It simply means that you don’t need one specific document that you update every time you learn something new. Agile development’s focus on frequent releases encourages an iterative learning process, so there’s no reason to waste time and energy managing a document.

### 9. More Collaboration

In offices that still use the waterfall method, some team members may rarely interact. Designers often send off their designs to developers and simply move on to the next task. In agile workplaces, designers and developers often sit next to each other while working collaboratively on each iteration, which results in a more polished final product.

## Keeping it Agile

When trying to hold yourself or your teammates to agile principles, **ask the following 5 questions** whenever someone throws out an idea:

1.  Will it help us achieve our goals?
2.  Is it consistent with our brand?
3.  Is there a better solution that already exists?
4.  What is the worst that could happen if we tried it?
5.  How will we evaluate whether or not the idea was effective?

Ongoing assessment is imperative to staying agile. Keeping what works and changing what doesn’t helps everything move toward completion as quickly as possible.
