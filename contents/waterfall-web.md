> Waterfall is the more traditional approach to product development. Itâ€™s carried out sequentially and is subsequently more rigid and arguably less effective.

Waterfall is sequential, Agile is incremental.

> Some benefits of agile (rather than waterfall) include the final product being released faster to market, being more collaborative and requiring incremental investments. On the flip side, it can make stakeholders nervous because of its flexible nature. It is also often misunderstood.
